## Workflow management

**Yes I know about snakeMake**, but I found that it has an annoying learning curve for the people coming from R background..

### SnakeMake Learning resources
+ [Building a bioinfo workflow](https://slowkow.com/notes/snakemake-tutorial/), by Kamil Slowikowski.
+ [Writing a snakemake](http://www.annotathon.org/courses/ABD/practical/snakemake/snake_intro.html), by Denis Puthier & Aitor Gonzalez.


### Alternatives (in R)

The blog on [Reproducing research with R](http://will-landau.com/2016/06/14/workflow/), mentions some interesting alternatives in R.
Especially [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake) and [ParallelRemake](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake). 
The later can also write remake make files.
